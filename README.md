# **CIFAR-10 Image Classification with GAN Data Augmentation and Gradio Interface**

This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classifying images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. By leveraging **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic images, we improve the training process and enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, the project is deployed using a **Gradio interface**, enabling real-time predictions through a sharable link accessible for **72 hours**.

## 🌐 **Overview**

The **CIFAR-10 dataset** consists of **60,000 color images** in 10 different classes:

- ✈️ Airplane
- 🚗 Automobile
- 🐦 Bird
- 🐱 Cat
- 🦌 Deer
- 🐶 Dog
- 🐸 Frog
- 🐴 Horse
- 🚢 Ship
- 🚚 Truck

With **50,000 training images** and **10,000 test images**, the goal of this project is to develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying these images. **Data augmentation** and **GAN-generated synthetic images** are used to improve the model’s generalization performance.
